Rocket launch display
-----
A web service that displays upcoming rocket launches from the [Launch Library
API](https://launchlibrary.net) on a 320x240 TFT touchscreen on a Raspi Zero.

During launches the display changes to show a countdown and go/no information.

The web front end is built in Flask.

Alerts via sms/whatsapp may be added later.
